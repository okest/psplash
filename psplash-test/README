PSPLASH
=======

PSplash is a userspace graphical boot splash screen for mainly
embedded Linux devices supporting a 16bpp or 32bpp framebuffer. It has
few dependencies (just libc), supports basic images and text and handles
rotation. Its visual look is configurable by commandline arguments and basic
source changes (mainly defines).

Also included is a 'client' command utility for sending information to
psplash such as boot progress information.
